      <p>Adopted from South Korea at the age of 3, I have lived the majority of my life in New Jersey. My professional career started as an intern at iMarketing LTD a digital marketing agency. I was tasked with helping one of the CRM or Account Manager with pulling reports, updating our event CMS, creating tracking links and trafficking them, creating banner images and setting them up on LinkedIn as well as Facebook. After working for a couple of years at iMarketing the business was bought out by Mercury Media and I was brought full time as an eCommerce Coordinator as well as Digital Media Specialist. After they closed the Princeton office I briefly worked at another marketing agency where I picked up the basics of Google Adwords. </p>

      <p>My personal asirpations would be to help small businesses but any size business improve their online presence with a clean user friendly website that is ready to be marketed. Less time wasted on revisions between Developers and your marketing team with me. Feel free to contact me via any of the social media icons. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
